I am a Research Master student at the Universiti Malaya, under the supervision of [Prof. Chuah Joon Huang](https://umexpert.um.edu.my/jhchuah.html), [Prof. Ting Hua Nong](https://umexpert.um.edu.my/tinghn.html). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Communication Engineering from Zhengzhou University in Jul, 2023. My research focuses on the application of deep learning to physiological signal processing. I am dedicated to developing and applying innovative deep learning models to solve complex problems in the analysis of physiological signals (such as ECG, PCG, PPG, etc.).

I expect to graduate by the end of 2025 and am currently seeking PhD or Research Assistant (RA) positions. I am eager to join a distinguished research team and work with a suitable supervisor to pursue cutting-edge academic research.
